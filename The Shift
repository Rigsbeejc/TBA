Hey everyone,

I've come to the decision of re-working Virtua-Mall into something else. It will no longer be the shopping application I had envisioned several months back.
The new Virtua-Mall will be a lighthearted, arcade-style game about shopping taken to the extreme. I will be repurposing elements from the original project into this new one.

It may seem like a late April Fools day joke, but it isn't. The expenses of using an API from the likes of Google or Amazon would be impossible to fund out-of-pocket.
Yes, it pains me to make this decision, but it's for the best I restrain my ambition as to not overwork myself.

The pre-release builds and documentation for the original Virtua-Mall project will still be available in this repository and will be labled 'Pre-Shift'.
